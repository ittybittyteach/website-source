I live in Camas Washington with my husband and two children. Both of my children are attending Camas High this year, one is a Senior and one a Freshman. We moved here a few years ago from Las Vegas Nevada and just fell in love with the Pacific North West. Camas is a wonderful welcoming community and we love it here. My favorite outdoor hobbies are hiking and mountain biking, when it’s not raining too bad. In the winter, I love to quilt, knit and crochet. When springtime comes around, my most favorite time of year, I am always out in the garden planting and tending to my flowers. When it’s time for a little relaxation, I like to sit on the porch with my husband and watch the birds in my garden while reading a good book.  

I believe in helping all students meet their potentials. Reading and writing go hand in hand, you can't do one without the other. I believe that you must support writing everyday for students to get stronger at reading and vise versa. The only way to get stronger is to work at it. There are alternative routes to reading and writing, and I am open to using new ideas that will engage students. I am about supporting student choice and having a student-centered classroom, where the student takes part of their own learning goals.
