I live in Camas Washington with my husband and two children. Both of my children are attending Camas High this year, one is a Senior and one a Freshman. We moved here a few years ago from Las Vegas Nevada and just fell in love with the Pacific North West. Camas is a wonderful welcoming community and we love it here. My favorite outdoor hobbies are hiking and mountain biking, when it’s not raining too bad. In the winter, I love to quilt, knit and crochet. When springtime comes around, my most favorite time of year, I am always out in the garden planting and tending to my flowers. When it’s time for a little relaxation, I like to sit on the porch with my husband and watch the birds in my garden while reading a good book.
