# Welcome Parents and Guardians
 
This is where I will be posting the latest and greatest up and coming events our class will be venturing on. We will be having a lot of fun this year in the second grade. There will be so much to do and so much to learn. Your students will be involved in our Mystery Science Projects, containing vast amounts of information in the natural sciences. Your children will be exploring the fascinating world of plants, butterflies, volcanoes, geology and electricity. We will also dive into many realistic non-fiction narratives of children around the world, teaching our students about their cultures and way of life from many different countries. Your students will also have a busy year engaging in our deep, all inclusive math curriculum of Bridges, which provides multiple entry points for various styles of learners. There are many exciting and interactive games which help to make learning easy and fun. This will be a great year of growth for your little one and I can't wait to help support them during this time. Please let me know by phone, email or in person if I can help support your student and family in any way I can. I am available after school hours from 2:30-4:00 or early morning hours by appointment. Please feel free to contact me any time, I will be sure to get back to you with in 24 hours. 555-555-5555 or email MrsMartin@school.gmail.com.
