# Need Chaperones 

# Heading to the zoo!

We're off to the zoo this week and we need some helpers. Moms and Dads that can be of help please see the front office for the forms to volunteer. These must be turned in and cleared with the front desk by Wednesday. 

At the zoo we will have a guide group and students will be paired up with parents. I will have packets for each of you who have already cleared with me and those that are still working with the office. Please give me a call if your getting the run around and I will try to get things moving along with your forms.

# All Parents!!!

Please remember the permission slips by Wednesday or your students will have to stay behind with the other teachers at school. That, unfortunately is the school policy. Please have your child also bring a sack lunch and not their lunch pails. We don't want them to lose them during our running around. Thank you for all of your support and if you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Mrs. M
