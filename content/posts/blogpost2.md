# Looking for classroom helpers

I am always looking for anyone who would like to help out in the classroom. Even if you like come in help organized books for an hour, any little bit is super useful. Please, send me an email with the date and times you are available.
 
 This week will be starting off a new unit on building our own theme parks. The kids are excited to get the creative juices flowing. They will be designing their theme parks with a problem to solve and then they will be writing about it. I just love this project every year. Students come up with the most creative and helpful ideas to make parks more inclusive for others. 

 We will also be using art and math to learn about symmetry. Using chalk and black paper, your students will be creating some magnificent butterflies with the idea of symmetry in mind. They will have to work hard to match both sides of their butterflies to the other.
